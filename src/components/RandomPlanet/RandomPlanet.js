                            Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. 
                            <br />
                            In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter,
                            <br /> 
                            the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times

                            the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.
                            <br /> 
                            Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass

                            causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Neptune orbits the Sun
